@QueryParam:
It works very similar to the @PathParam parameter

Param Annotations:

1. Accessing Header Param = @HeaderParam
2. Accessing Matrix Param  = @MatrixParam
3. Accessing Cookie values  = @CookieParam

The above annotations are in addition to the @PathParam and @QueryParam annotations

4. Accessing Form Values = @FormParam

By using the @Context Param you can access the UriInfo and also the HTTPHeader information

5. Using the @BeanParam 

We can use the @BeanParam and access the member variables of the bean class
