Step Three: Install cURL

Depending on if your system is 32 or 64 bit, download the corresponding** curl.exe.** For example, go to the Win64 - Generic section and download the Win64 binary with SSL support (the one where SSL is not crossed out).

Do not skip this step. Download a recent copy of valid CERT files from https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem Copy it to the same folder as you placed curl.exe (C:\Windows\System32) and rename it as curl-ca-bundle.crt
