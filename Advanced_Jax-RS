Alternative way of bootstrapping a JAX-RS Application:

moxy:
The framework to convert from java instances to the JSON instances
-> We have added moxy which converts the java instances to JSON.
-> Changed the build configuration from java 5 to java 7

-> All the jersey dependencies and moxy dependencies have been added to Pom.xml file
-> Throw in properties for jersey version and encoding


Adding Java classes:

-> Will be adding classes in src/main/java

Singleton:

to make a resource singleton, annotate it with @singleton

-> if we make multiple requests it is held on to the same request of a class.

Singleton resources vs per request resources:

per request life cycle is a default life cycle whereas singleton scope holds on to the instance.
